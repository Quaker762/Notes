Lang Files:
Instead of the "KnownLangFiles" class used in the original Notes, 
scroll through the lang directory until a match is found.
Read the name of the lang from the propfile, and scroll through all the 
file names in the directory until it is found.

Save messages (such as "Do you want to save") to a string in the lang file.
The actual message string (probably static) will be equal to the translated 
sentence.
